## Historical Context

Understanding the historical evolution of Deutsche Börse's trading infrastructure provides important context for its current technological architecture.

### Xetra Launch and IBIS Transition

Xetra's launch on November 28, 1997, marked a pivotal transformation in German equity trading. The system replaced IBIS, which had served as an electronic order book system since the late 1980s. The transition to Xetra represented a complete shift from floor-based trading to a fully electronic, screen-based continuous auction model. This transformation enabled higher trading speeds, greater transparency, and the foundation for algorithmic and high-frequency trading strategies. *(Source: [Xetra History](https://www.xetra.com))*

### Eurex Ownership Evolution

Eurex began as a joint venture between Deutsche Börse and SIX Swiss Exchange, combining the derivatives trading activities of both the Frankfurt and Swiss exchanges. In January 2012, Deutsche Börse acquired full ownership of Eurex, consolidating control over the derivatives platform and aligning it fully with Deutsche Börse's strategic direction. *(Source: [Eurex Exchange](https://www.eurex.com))*

### Clearstream Acquisition

The full acquisition of Clearstream in July 2002 represented a strategic vertical integration, bringing post-trade settlement and custody services under Deutsche Börse's control. This integration created a seamless value chain from trade execution through clearing and settlement. *(Source: [Deutsche Börse Corporate History](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com))*

These regulatory frameworks establish requirements for market transparency, trade reporting, pre-trade and post-trade transparency, best execution, and risk management.

**FIX Protocol Support**
For participants preferring industry-standard connectivity, Deutsche Börse supports FIX (Financial Information eXchange) protocol connectivity to both Xetra and Eurex.

**Proximity Hosting**
Deutsche Börse offers co-location services, enabling trading firms to place their servers in close physical proximity to the exchange matching engines, minimizing network latency.

**Network Infrastructure (N7)**
The N7 network provides dedicated, low-latency connectivity between trading participants and the exchange infrastructure, optimized for high-frequency trading requirements.

## Conclusion

Deutsche Börse represents a comprehensive capital markets infrastructure provider, combining trading venues, clearing services, settlement systems, and data products into an integrated ecosystem. The organization's evolution from floor-based trading to fully electronic markets, exemplified by Xetra's launch in 1997 and the continuous development of the T7 platform, has positioned it as a technology leader in European exchanges.
